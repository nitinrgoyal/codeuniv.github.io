To test that you've got Node.js correctly installed on your computer, open a new terminal (command prompt) and type `node --help` and you should see the usage documentation. To check the version of node type `node -v` and you should see version installed.

Node.js is a platform for building fast and scalable server applications using JavaScript. Node.js is the runtime and npm is the Package Manager for Node.js modules.

Create a JS file and write 
```
let message = "Hello World";
console.log(message);
```

Open Terminal / Command Prompt and go to the directory where "hello.js" is saved.
Run command "node hello.js"
You should see the `Hello World`
